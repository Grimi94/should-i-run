# Should I Run? - Press Release

> *We help you catch the first possible train using real-time transit data.*

'Should I Run?' is an iPhone app for the daily commuter. Using real-time transit data, we tell you if you need to hustle to make the next train, or can just take it easy. 'Should I Run?' takes the guesswork out of your commute with a few quick taps.

We recognize that transit users don't want to miss a train they could have made. But at the same time it's hard to quickly get access to all of the information needed to make a train.

> "This app gives you the information you need to spend less time on the platform," says ‘Should I Run’s founder Roger Goldfinger

To use, just download the app and tap in your destination. We’ll do the hard work of getting real time data and present it to you in a way that allows you to see – at a glance – how to catch the first possible train.

‘Should I Run?’ is already a hit with its customers. One loyal user customer commented: "’Should I run?’ helped me catch an earlier train, where I met the love of my life."
